What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git init creates a git repository in the current directory, but it is an empty repository. If you "git log" it, it will give you an error. To check its current status you should use "git status".

I need to initialyse a directory because without doing it git doesnt know that it should keep track of changes there and creates its auxiliary files on hidden directory .git



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area defines what will be moved to the repository in the next commit. It makes us able to organize and define commits much more flexible.
